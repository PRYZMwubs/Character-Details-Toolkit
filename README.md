# Character Details Toolkit
This is a minimal application I'm working on in my spare time, made specifically for fiction writers, to generate random details for their characters. This project also serves mostly as a way for me to get practice with Godot, as I've been learning it recently. Currently, the program only supports generating a random sexuality/orientation for your characters, but more features will be coming along eventually, as I do hope to make this an actual helpful piece of software in the future.

Feel free to fork/modify it and/or use it for any of your needs. All I ask is that if this is publicly redistributed or forked anywhere that I am credited with a link back to this page somewhere.
